## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee data from Salifort Motors to identify patterns and predict which employees are likely to leave the company. By understanding the key factors driving employee turnover, the company can take proactive measures to improve retention and reduce recruitment costs.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

**Challenge:** Salifort Motors was experiencing high employee turnover, leading to:
- Increased recruitment and training costs
- Loss of institutional knowledge
- Decreased team morale and productivity

**Goal:** Build a predictive model to identify at-risk employees and understand the main factors contributing to attrition.

## 🔍 Methodology

This project follows the **PACE framework**:

1. **Plan** - Defined business objectives and success metrics
2. **Analyze** - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand data patterns
3. **Construct** - Built and tested multiple machine learning models
4. **Execute** - Selected best model and generated actionable insights

## 📈 Key Findings

### Model Performance
- **Algorithm Used:** Random Forest Classifier
- **F1-Score:** 76.2%
- **Accuracy:** High predictive accuracy on test data
- **Key Predictors:** Work hours, satisfaction level, tenure, and project count

### Business Insights
✅ Employees working excessive hours (>240/month) show higher attrition risk  
✅ Low satisfaction scores strongly correlate with turnover  
✅ Employees with 3-5 years tenure are most at-risk  
✅ Overloading employees with projects increases resignation likelihood
